# Alice Lens

The Alice Lens application is built within Unity 2018.2.15f1 using the Vuforia Unity package for augmented reality image target detection and database. Within this latest version of the application there are multiple scenes that follow similar priciples in terms of what is within. These scenes contain augmentable videos, images, 3D models, button links, scene switchers, etc.

## Getting Started

The Alice Lens project is meant to be simple and easy to develop for. The ability to add and remove AR content has been simplified to the point of copy & paste and drag & drop. If there are any additional pieces that you believe should be added to this readme, reach out with suggested additions/changes to better enhance the documentation. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

**Unity 2018.2.15f1** 
>In order to open the project make sure you are on the same version of Unity (2018.2.15f1) for the most seamless experience. If using another Unity version you run the risk ok prefabs beging broken, missing scripts, and other errors. The simplest way to maintain multiple different versions of Unity is by having the program Unity Hub. All versions of Unity can be found at the following link to download: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive

**Access to company Vuforia account** 
>This account is used to create a vuforia license to use Vuforia AR Framework. This is also how you input image targets to be rated for augmentable rating (Expresses quality of image target to track and stability) and to be downloaded to be put in the scene. If access is needed for Vuforia reach out to Lead Developer.

### Installing

Simply pull the repo into Github desktop to keep track of the most up to date pulls and make your own pushes. Github best practices to follow are coming soon and will be linked here. 

Once you have the project downloaded and the proper Unity version installed open the project and all parts of the project should be accurate in terms of UI, functioanlity, UI, etc.
