# AliceLens™
  The AliceLens™ application is an iOS & Android build using emerging technologies. Within this application there is a focus on augmented reality using target based tracking. Through use cases within the application, we show off a new way of learning.
  
# AliceLens™ Targets
  In order to experience the augmented reality within the application, please check out this link to download the image targets. Once downloaded then point the AliceLens™ application at the image target.

**- Grab the targets you downloaded from the dropbox link and point the AliceLens™ at it. Depending on which target you are pointing at you see a few different AR experiences.**

# Technologies Used

### Vuforia

```Vuforia is an Augmented Reality Software Development Kit (SDK) for mobile devices that enables the creation of Augmented Reality applications. It uses Computer Vision technology to recognize and track planar images (Image Targets) and simple 3D objects, such as boxes, in real-time. This image registration capability enables developers to position and orient virtual objects, such as 3D models and other media, in relation to real world images when these are viewed through the camera of a mobile device.```

### Unity 3D

```Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, which is primarily used to develop both three-dimensional and two-dimensional video games and simulations for computers, consoles, and mobile devices.```
